#### Included :boom: Sample Projects so far:

* **UIViewController**
* **UINavigationController** with example of: 
	* Center a UILabel using Auto Layout Visual Format Language constrainsts.
* **Custom** **ViewController** **transition** with:
	*  Extension to the 'Selector' type with static constants holding the selectors for the methods we are calling in our class, (usable in Xcode 7.3+, Swift 2.2+).
	* Log for the app launch time.
	* An Enum with no cases holding namespaced constants for the Colors in the app.
	* A  Enum type creating our namespace for constants representing the images used in the app. 
* **Simple TableView Navigation** with:
	* **Self-Sizing cells** where the cell height is determined by the cell's content using Auto Layout -- the more text in the text view, the taller the cell.
	* **Use of dynamic type**, which allows the user to change the font size at runtime. As the font size changes, the cells automatically adjust their size.
